# UFC_Fight_data_python
UFC_Fight Data project is a list of data reviewed from Kaggle with every UFC fight in the history of the organization from 1993-2020. Every row contains statistics about both fighters, fight details and the winner. The original source 
from the Kaggle author does contain the raw data files, preprocessed data, and a final merged data set. There were originally 144 columns in the data set. This was narrowed down to 41 columns to focus on marketing and insights for a smaller set of the data.

# Objective
To source my own project The UFC Data set and make an initial data and exploratory analysis in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for general public fan review and possible marketing & sales strategies derived from analysis.

# Data
I sourced the data set from Kaggle and it contained raw data and also created additional data sets and folders below: 

Json Maps folder containing: World and USA states files. 

Original Data Folder containing: UFC_raw.csv file

Prepared Data Folder containing: UFC_csv, UFC_wrangled, UFC_wrangled_new, UFC_wrangled_win_loss_overall. (these are all csv files)

Project Management: Contains the Project Brief

Data: Separated into Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. NOTE: This folder has not been included due to file size constraints

Scripts: Contains all the Python coding involved for the entire analysis process

Analysis: Contains the Visualizations used for developing insights and presenting on the final report
